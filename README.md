# The Odin Project: Recipes
## About
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) is a free, open-source curriculum for web development. As somebody that values strong fundamentals, I have decided to follow the curriculum to strengthen any foundational weaknesses I may have, as well as evaluate whether I should recommend The Odin Project to my friends. This specific project is about creating a simple, HTML recipe webpage.
